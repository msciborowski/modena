Create complete react project based on given html and css template
scan carefully entire application for all the information you need

- configure mui theme to follow based colors 
- configure default fonts for headers and other components exactly as in given template

While implementing:
- match your existing project architecture
- main component is App.tsx, create container and put there all the sub-components extracted straight from the template as Header, Gallery, Contact, Footer etc.
- page must follow a11y standards
- page must be both desktop and mobile friendly - this is very important

My coding preferences
- code must build, and lint must pass
- no inline styling, prefer styling in component file using @emotion/react
- make code clean and if in doubt follow Airbnb ESLint rules
- use functional components only
- no default exports
- use arrow functions
- use strict TypeScript types, no any
- prefer useMemo over recalculation
- accessibility compliant
- avoid unnecessary re-renders in react components
